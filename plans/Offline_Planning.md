# Ventry â€” Offline Event Check-In App Implementation Plan

## 1. Vision & Goals

Deliver an ultra-simple, efficient mobile application for organizers of small-to-medium events, clubs, and restaurants to manage attendee/member lists and perform fast digital check-ins via list search or QR code scanning, with **complete offline functionality** that works without internet connectivity.

---

## 2. Target Users & Scenarios

### 2.1 Small Event Organizers (e.g., Workshops, Classes)
- **Needs:** Manage attendee lists, replace paper sign-ins, track attendance, handle walk-ins.
- **Data:** Name, Email (optional).
- **Check-in:** Fast Name Search (primary), QR scan (bonus).
- **Offline Capability:** Complete functionality without internet.

### 2.2 Club Managers (e.g., Social Clubs)
- **Needs:** Verify membership, track attendance, manage member tiers.
- **Data:** Name, Membership ID, Status (Active/Expired), Expiry Date (optional).
- **Check-in:** QR Scan (primary), Name/ID Search.
- **Offline Capability:** Full membership verification locally.

### 2.3 Restaurant Managers (Loyalty/Events)
- **Needs:** Check-in for events, identify loyalty/VIP members, track visits/points.
- **Data:** Name, Phone/Email, Status (VIP/Loyalty), Points/Visits (optional).
- **Check-in:** Name/Phone Search or QR Scan.
- **Offline Capability:** Local tracking of loyalty points/visits.

---

## 3. Core App Modules (Offline-First)

- **Local Account Management:** Local user profiles stored on device.
- **Event/Activity Management:** Create, edit, archive events or ongoing activities locally.
- **Attendee/Member Management:** Import, view, manage lists; manual add - all stored locally.
- **Live Check-In Screen:** Main interface for check-in with no internet dependency.
- **Local Reporting:** Basic check-in counts, export attendance to local storage.
- **Data Backup:** Export/import app data to/from local files.

---

## 4. Data Import Strategy

### 4.1 Primary: CSV File Import from Device Storage
- **Location:** Within each Event/Activity screen.
- **Process:** User selects CSV file from device storage; app validates required columns and reports errors.
- **Templates:**
  - *General Event:* FirstName, LastName, Email (optional)
  - *Club:* FirstName, LastName, MembershipID, Status, ExpiryDate (optional)
  - *Restaurant:* FirstName, LastName, Email/Phone, Status/Tag, Points (optional)

### 4.2 Secondary: Manual Entry
- **Location:** Attendee list and Live Check-In screen.
- **Fields:** Context-driven (minimum: Name; plus Status/ID if needed).

### 4.3 Data Export
- **Purpose:** Allow backing up data to CSV files on device storage.
- **Format:** Standardized CSV export for events, attendees, and check-in logs.

---

## 5. Check-In Process (Fully Offline)

### 5.1 Access
- User opens app, selects event/activity from local storage, loads attendee list, opens check-in screen.

### 5.2 Method 1: Digital List Search & Tap
- **Search:** Instant filtering by Name/ID/Phone using local database.
- **Select:** Tap attendee, confirm, mark as checked-in with timestamp and visual feedback.
- **Duplicate:** Warn if already checked in based on local records.

### 5.3 Method 2: QR Code Scanning
- **Initiate:** Tap "Scan QR Code" button.
- **Process:** Scan attendee QR, validate against local event list and status.
- **Feedback:**
  - *Success:* Green, attendee info, check-in recorded locally.
  - *Duplicate:* Yellow/orange, already checked-in warning.
  - *Invalid:* Red, not found/expired/invalid message.

### 5.4 Context-Aware Display
- Show relevant info (e.g., Name, Status, Points) based on event type.

### 5.5 Walk-in Handling
- Prominent "+ Add Attendee" for manual entry and immediate check-in to local database.

---

## 6. Data Management (Local-First)

- **Entities:** User, Event/Activity, Person (flexible fields), Check-In Log.
- **Storage:** All data stored in local SQLite database on device.
- **Backup:** Export/import functionality for data backup and transfer.

## 13. Summary

This offline implementation plan transforms the Simple Check-In Helper into a completely self-contained React Native application built with Expo. By leveraging Expo's powerful modules, React Native's cross-platform capabilities, and efficient local data management, the app provides all core functionality while running entirely on the user's device. This approach is particularly well-suited for environments with limited or unreliable internet access, such as in Ethiopia and similar markets.
